#Algorithm for project TileTraveller
#1. Program prints valid directions to move from current tile
#2. If player choses not valid direction program prints on screen Not valid direction!
#3. If player choses vaild move he moves to the next tile
#4. When player reaches final tile 3.1 he wins the game
#5. Program goes back to line 1 if not on final tile
